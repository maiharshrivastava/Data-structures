Certainly! Here's the README file with the `reverseLinkedList` function code snippet added:

```markdown
# reverseLinkedList Function

The `reverseLinkedList` function is used to reverse a singly linked list.

## Function Signature

```cpp
LinkedListNode<int>* reverseLinkedList(LinkedListNode<int>* head);
```

## Parameters

- `head`: A pointer to the head of the linked list that needs to be reversed.

## Return Value

- Returns a pointer to the head of the reversed linked list.

## Description

The function takes the head of a singly linked list as input and reverses the order of the nodes in the list. It uses an iterative reversal technique where it iterates through the list, changing the next pointer of each node to point to its previous node, effectively reversing the list.

## Code

```cpp
LinkedListNode<int>* reverseLinkedList(LinkedListNode<int>* head) 
{
    if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) {
        return head;
    }

    LinkedListNode<int>* prev = NULL;
    LinkedListNode<int>* curr = head;
    LinkedListNode<int>* forward = NULL;

    while (curr != NULL) {
        forward = curr->next;
        curr->next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = forward;
    }

    return prev;
}
```

Feel free to use this function in your projects and modify the code as needed.
