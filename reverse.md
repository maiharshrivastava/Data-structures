Certainly! Here's the README file with the `reverseLinkedList` function code snippet added:

```markdown
# reverseLinkedList Function

The `reverseLinkedList` function is used to reverse a singly linked list.

## Function Signature

```cpp
LinkedListNode<int>* reverseLinkedList(LinkedListNode<int>* head);
```

## Parameters

- `head`: A pointer to the head of the linked list that needs to be reversed.

## Return Value

- Returns a pointer to the head of the reversed linked list.

## Description

The function takes the head of a singly linked list as input and reverses the order of the nodes in the list. It uses an iterative reversal technique where it iterates through the list, changing the next pointer of each node to point to its previous node, effectively reversing the list.

## Code

```cpp
LinkedListNode<int>* reverseLinkedList(LinkedListNode<int>* head) 
{
    if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) {
        return head;
    }

    LinkedListNode<int>* prev = NULL;
    LinkedListNode<int>* curr = head;
    LinkedListNode<int>* forward = NULL;

    while (curr != NULL) {
        forward = curr->next;
        curr->next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = forward;
    }

    return prev;
}
```

Feel free to use this function in your projects and modify the code as needed.

You can copy and paste this markdown code into your README file. Adjust it as necessary for your project documentation.



It seems like there's a misunderstanding regarding the use of `Node` and its scope. The error indicates that `Node` is not declared in the scope of your code. 

Assuming `Node` is supposed to represent a linked list node, let's make sure it's properly defined. Here's how you can adjust your code:

```cpp
// Define LinkedListNode structure
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int val) : data(val), next(nullptr) {}
};

// Define the reverse function
void reverse(Node* &head, Node* curr, Node* prev) {
    if (curr == nullptr) {
        head = prev;
        return;
    }

    Node* forward = curr->next;
    curr->next = prev;
    reverse(head, forward, curr);
}

// Define the reverseLinkedList function
Node* reverseLinkedList(Node* head) {
    Node* curr = head;
    Node* prev = nullptr;
    reverse(head, curr, prev);
    return head;
}
```

In this code:

- `Node` is defined as a structure representing a linked list node.
- The `reverse` function recursively reverses the linked list, and it's properly defined with `Node` as the parameter type.
- The `reverseLinkedList` function serves as a wrapper to call `reverse` with appropriate initial parameters and returns the head of the reversed list.

Ensure that `Node` is properly defined in your codebase and adjust the code accordingly if needed.
